What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Using and Algorithm cipher to encrpt data was something i felt i did well. Secure coding is important to protect not only your property but the property of your users. It helps the companies well being because no one would want to deal with them if they knew that their personal data was able to be easly aquired.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I had some issues with self signing and having it show as secure on my localhost but other than that after some practice i found it rather easy.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Updated outdated versions of the libraries was seemly the most important and simple ways to add layers of security as new versions of the libraries would often time address found vulnerabiltie but using penetration testing in the future will better assess the additional vulnerabilities within the code.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I would continously debug as i wrote the code then run a vulnerabilty test to see if i had created any new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Honestly, Looking at multible different sources such as youtube and the like to help me better understand issues I am having has always been my go to when I have any problems.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
My knownledge of Algothithm Ciphers, Certificate Generations and vulnerability testing.
